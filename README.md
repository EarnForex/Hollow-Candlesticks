# Hollow Candlesticks

Hollow Candlesticks is a custom MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. It can be used to display a hollow candlestick chart in your MetaTrader 5 platform.

It is recommended to set your MetaTrader's chart colors to None to leave only this indicator's display and get a clear hollow candles chart.
